There is also a HTML attribute called tabindex which allows you to change the tabbing index—which is order in which elements are focused—every 
time someone presses their tab key, or focus is shifted with a hash change in the URL or by a JavaScript event.

If tabindex on a HTML element is set to 0, it can receive focus via the tab key and it will honour the global tab index,
which is defined by the document source order.

If you set tabindex to -1, it can only receive focus programmatically, which means only when a JavaScript event happens or a hash change
(matching the element's id in the URL) occurs.

If you set tabindex to be anything higher than 0, it will be removed from the global tab index, defined by document source order.
Tabbing order will now be defined by the value of tabindex, so an element with tabindex="1" will receive focus before an element with tabindex="2",
for example.


Warning

Honoring document source order is really important, and focus order should only be changed if you absolutely have to change it.
This applies both when setting tabindexand changing visual order with CSS layout, such as flexbox and grid.
Anything that creates unpredictable focus on the web can create an inaccessible experience for the user.


a:focus {
  outline: 2px solid slateblue;
  outline-offset: 60px;
}

==========================================================================================================================================


Currently in some browsers, if you have a border-radius set on your element and use outline, it won't match—the outline will have sharp corners.
Due to this, it is tempting to use a box-shadow with a small blur radius because box-shadow clips to the shape, honouring border-radius, 
but this style will not show in Windows High Contrast Mode.
This is because Windows High Contrast Mode doesn't apply shadows, and mostly ignores background images to favor the user's preferred settings.

In summary #

Creating a focus state that has contrast with an element's default state is incredibly important.
The default browser styles do this already for you, but if you want to change this behaviour, remember the following:

1- Avoid using outline: none on an element that can receive keyboard focus.
2- Avoid replacing outline styles with box-shadow. as they don't show up in Windows High Contrast Mode.
3- Only set a positive value for tabindex on an HTML element if you absolutely have to.
4- Make sure the focus state is very clear vs the default state.
